Combine text and numbers
Applies To: Excel 2007

Let's say you want to create a grammatically correct sentence from several columns of data for a mass mailing or format numbers with text without affecting formulas that use those numbers. There are several ways to combine text and numbers.
What do you want to do?

    Display text before or after a number in a cell by using a number format

    Combine text and numbers from different cells into the same cell by using a formula

    Functions details

Display text before or after a number in a cell by using a number format

If a column that you want to sort contains both numbers and text (such as Product #15, Product #100, Product #200), it may not sort as expected. You can use a number format to add text without changing the sorting behavior of the number.

    Select the cells that you want to format.

    On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the arrow, and then click More.

    In the Category list, click a category, and then click a built-in format that resembles the one that you want.

    In the Category list, click Custom.

    In the Type box, edit the number format codes to create the format that you want.

    To display both text and numbers in a cell, enclose the text characters in double quotation marks (" ") or precede the numbers with a backslash (\). Editing a built-in format does not remove the format.

To display
	

Use this code

12 as Product #12
	

"Product # " 0

12:00 as 12:00 AM EST
	

h:mm AM/PM "EST"

-12 as $-12.00 Shortage and 12 as $12.00 Surplus
	

$0.00 "Surplus";$-0.00 "Shortage"

Combine text and numbers from different cells into the same cell by using a formula

List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This is a list of the longest running U.S. primetime television series, ordered by the number of broadcast seasons offered by a U.S. broadcast network or cable network in prime time on the show's original run.

Dear readers, time is running out in 2016 to help Wikipedia. To protect our independence, we'll never run ads. We're sustained by donations averaging about $15. If everyone reading this right now gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. That's right, the price of a cup of coffee is all we need. If Wikipedia is useful to you, please take one minute to keep it online and growing. Thank you.

Formula
	

Description (Result)

=A2&" sold "&B2&" units."
	

Combines contents above into a phrase (Buchanan sold 28 units)

=A3&" sold "&TEXT(B3,"0%")&" of the total sales."
	

Combines contents above into a phrase (Dodsworth sold 40% of the total sales)

=CONCATENATE(A2," sold ",B2," units.")
	

Combines contents above into a phrase (Buchanan sold 28 units)

Note the use of the TEXT function in the formula. When you join a number to a string of text by using the concatenation operator, use the TEXT function to format the number. The formula uses the underlying value from the referenced cell (.4 in this example) — not the formatted value you see in the cell (40%). The TEXT function restores the number formatting.
